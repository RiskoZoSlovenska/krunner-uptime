# krunner-uptime

A very simple KDE Plasma 6 KRunner plugin that displays the current system uptime. Partially a learning project for working with KDE libraries, Qt, CMake and packaging.

![A screenshot of the plugin in action](demo.png)

The trigger word defaults to "uptime" in English, but can be configured by setting the `trigger` property under the `[Runners][krunner_uptime]` section in your `krunnerrc` file.

Pull requests of any kind welcome!
